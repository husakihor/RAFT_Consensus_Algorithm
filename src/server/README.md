# The Server class

* In this folder, you can find our Server class that is used to parse the logs from the clients and make sure that all the servers has the same logs at the end of the program.
* To do that we are using the RAFT protocol, as seen in class.
* You can find here some sources that we used during the implementation of the RAFT algorithm and the logs replication :
